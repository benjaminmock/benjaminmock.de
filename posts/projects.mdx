At irregular intervals and mostly far too seldom, I share content and learnings on <a href="https://codesnacks.net/">codesnacks.net</a>, mainly on frontend topics. The page itself is built using Remix and Tailwind to collect experience in frameworks/libraries that I don't use on a daily basis.

I also used to post byte-sized JavaScript tipps and tricks on <a href="https://dev.to/benjaminmock">dev.to</a>.


There's another one [here](/posts/example-post).
